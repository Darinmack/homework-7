1. What does it mean to escape data? How does escaping data help us avoid malicious
code?
Escaping data refers to sanitizing or encoding user input or any data that is being sent to a system or displayed on a webpage 
in such a way that it cannot be interpreted as executable code. This helps  to prevent security vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, so the script will no longer be harmful.
2. 
a. What is REST? What is meant by Statelessness?
 REST stands for Representational State Transfer, and is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web,
  making it easier for systems to communicate with each other.
  Systems that follow the REST paradigm are stateless, meaning that the server does not need to know anything about what state the client is in and vice versa. 
  In this way, both the server and the client can understand any message received, even without seeing previous messages.

b. What is a resource?
Resources are the nouns of the Web - 
they describe any object, document, or thing that you may need to store or send to other services.

c. Look at the section on Path design: In a RESTful architecture paradigm what
would be the proper way to create a path for: (provide URL and HTTP method):
i. getting a list of users?
HTTP method : GET 
GET http://fashionboutique.com/customers

ii. getting a particular user?
HHTP:GET 
GET http://fashionboutique.com/customers/123
iii. saving a user?
HTTP method: POST
POST http://fashionboutique.com/customers

3. What is a Cookie?
A website can tell a browser to store data about the user in a text file 
each time browsers requests another page from that site, browser sends data in the cookie back to server

4. What is a Session?
A way of maintaining state information about a user's interactions with a website or web application(like the time spent
interacting with website or web application from when they log in until they log out or session expires )
