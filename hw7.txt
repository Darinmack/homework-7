Some Similarities are:
Some Similarities are both use semicolons to end statements and curly braces to define blocks of code.
 Both PHP and JavaScript allow for dynamic and interactive web pages. PHP can generate dynamic content on the server-side, while JavaScript is able to manipulate the content and behavior of web pages on the client-side.
 Both languages support variables and various data types such as strings, numbers, arrays, and objects.

While some Differences are: 
Server vs. Client-Side: PHP is executed on the server-side, meaning it runs on the web server before the page is sent to the client's browser. JavaScript, on the other hand, is executed on the client-side, meaning it runs in the user's browser after the page has been delivered.
PHP is primarily used for server-side/back-end scripting, such as generating dynamic web pages and interacting with databases. JavaScript is mainly used for client-side/front-end scripting, such as validating forms, creating interactive interfaces, and manipulating the DOM.
 PHP typically runs in a server environment, such as Apache, while JavaScript runs in a browser environment

MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, which is a design pattern commonly used in web development to separate the concerns of an application into three interconnected parts: Model, View, Controller

Model: Manages the data and business logic of the application(interacts with the database)
View: Presents the data to the user in a specific format. (defines display)
Controller: Handles user input, interacts with the model, and determines which view to display.( so it basically decides and controls how data gets shown)
